## Overview
*BusyBreak* is a travel assistant application that helps users manage their travel itineraries, budgets, and activities.  

It is a Java-based CLI program designed to simplify trip planning and expense tracking by maintaining synchronization 
between the Activity and Budget modules.

## Summary of Contributions

### **New feature: Budget Management**
* **What it does**: Implemented the `BudgetPlan.java` class to handle all core budgeting logic, including adding, 
listing, deleting, and categorizing expenses.
* **Highlights**: Acts as the foundation of the budgeting subsystem, providing automatic synchronization with the 
Activity module to ensure accurate expense tracking and prevent data inconsistency.

---

### **New feature: `Budget` Command**
* **What it does**: Implemented the `Budget.java` command handler, enabling user interaction through commands such 
as `budget set`, `budget add`, `budget delete`, `budget list`, `budget setcat`, `budget sync` and `breakdown`.
* **Highlights**: Offers a structured CLI interface for managing budgets with detailed user feedback and validation for
every command.

---

### **New feature: Activity–Budget Synchronization**
* **What it does**: Linked the Budget and Activity modules through automatic synchronization, ensuring Activity-related
expenses are reflected accurately in the Budget.
* **Highlights**: Maintains real-time consistency between both modules, preventing duplicate or outdated data.

---

### **Enhancement: Category Protection Logic**
* **What it does**: Added logic to prevent modification or deletion of Activity-linked expenses through Budget commands.
* **Highlights**: Improves data reliability by ensuring Activity-related costs are managed only through Activity commands.

---

### **Enhancement: CLI Feedback Standardization**
* **What it does**: Standardized printed outputs and error handling across all Budget-related features.
* **Highlights**: Provides clearer, more consistent feedback for users and simplifies debugging for developers.
