## Managing Budget

The **Budget feature** allows you to track and categorize travel expenses and view how much budget remains.<br/>

---

### Setting the Total Budget: `budget set`

Sets the total budget amount for your trip.<br/>
This represents the **maximum amount** you plan to spend across all expenses.<br/>

Format: `budget set AMOUNT`<br/>
* The **AMOUNT** should be a positive number.<br/>
* The unit of **AMOUNT** is the Singapore dollar (SGD).<br/>

Examples:<br/>
* `budget set 500`<br/>

Expected output:<br/>
```
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Budget set to $500.00
----------------------------------------------------------------------
```
If a new value is set, the remaining budget will be recalculated automatically.<br/>

---

### Adding an Expense: `budget add`

Adds a new expense to the budget list.<br/>
Format: `budget add n/NAME c/COST cat/CATEGORY`<br/>

* The **NAME** is a short label for the expense.<br/>
* The **COST** should be a positive number (in SGD).<br/>
* The **CATEGORY** is optional â€” if omitted, it defaults to `Uncategorized`.<br/>

Examples:<br/>
* `budget add n/Snacks c/5 cat/Food`<br/>
* `budget add n/Taxi c/12.50 cat/Transport`<br/>
* `budget add n/Souvenirs c/20`<br/>

---

### âš  Activity Expense Restriction

Expenses in the **Activity** category **must be created via Activity commands**, because activities require a date and time.<br/>

If the user tries to add an Activity expense through `budget add`, the system blocks it and suggests the correct format.<br/>

---

### Listing Expenses: `budget list`

Displays all recorded expenses with total spent and remaining budget.<br/>
Format: `budget list`<br/>

Example output:<br/>

---

### Deleting an Expense: `budget delete`

Removes an expense by its index number.<br/>
Format: `budget delete INDEX`<br/>

* The **INDEX** is the number shown in `budget list`.<br/>

Example:<br/>
* `budget delete 2`


### ðŸ›‘ Restricting Edits to Activity-Linked Expenses

Expenses in the **Activity** category are *linked to activities in your itinerary*.<br/>
Because these expenses depend on **date**, **time**, and **description** stored in the activity list, 
they **cannot be edited directly through `budget` commands**.<br/>

If the user attempts to **delete** an Activity-linked expense through `'budget delete'`, 
the system blocks it and suggests the correct command:<br/>
---

### Changing Expense Category: `budget setcat`

Updates the category of an existing expense.<br/>
Format: `budget setcat INDEX NEW_CATEGORY`<br/>

Example:<br/>
* `budget setcat 1 Travel`<br/>

**Note:** If the expense was created from an Activity, its category **cannot** be changed here.
Edit the Activity instead using `edit` from the Activity command set.

---

### Syncing Expenses with Activities: `budget sync`

Ensures that new activities are automatically reflected in the budget.<br/>
Format: `budget sync`<br/>

Example:<br/>
* `budget sync`<br/>

---
